Start server by using 
    docker-compose build
    docker-compose up

in a separate terminal:
    run 
        python3 run_tests.py    (for all tests),
    or
        python3 name_of_test.py (select a single test file)

then you can run down the docker container with ctrl+c and delete the data of that test docker image.
